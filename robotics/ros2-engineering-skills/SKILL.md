# ROS 2 Engineering Skills

> **Single responsibility:** This skill is an **API reference & code template guide**
> for ROS 2 development. It tells you *how to use ROS 2 APIs correctly* and
> *what mistakes to avoid*. It does NOT do CI/CD orchestration, incident response,
> data analysis, or deployment automation — those are separate skill categories.

A progressive-disclosure skill for ROS 2 development — from first workspace to
production fleet deployment. Detailed patterns and code templates live in
`references/`; read the relevant file before writing code.

## How to use this skill

This always-loaded file carries routing, core principles, pitfalls, and
anti-patterns — enough for quick questions and architectural decisions.
For implementation work, use the Decision Router below to load the
reference file(s) matching the task; the AI pitfalls table lists mistakes
worth re-checking before generating code. `scripts/` are tools to run
(scaffolding, QoS checking, launch validation), not reading material.
When domains intersect (e.g. Nav2 + ros2_control) and recommendations
conflict, favor safety > determinism > simplicity.

**Execution log (opt-in):** When the Stop hook runs (Claude Code only) *and*
the `SKILL_RUNS_LOG` environment variable is set, a session summary is
appended to `.skill-runs.log`. If that file exists in the workspace, read the
last few lines to avoid repeating past mistakes. Without the opt-in — and on
platforms without hooks — the file is never created, so a read-only session
leaves the working tree untouched.

**Platform support:** `SKILL.md` and `references/` are platform-neutral
knowledge documents. `scripts/` can be run manually on any platform whose
environment has Python and the repository dependencies. The hook wiring
(automatic execution) and `.skill-runs.log` are Claude Code-specific; on
other platforms run the validators manually from the skill root:
`SKILL_WORKSPACE=<dir> python3 scripts/skill_stop_hook.py` and
`python3 scripts/skill_validate_hook.py --file <src> / --command '<cmd>'`
(the command string is inspected only, never executed; without those flags
the validate hook expects a Claude Code PreToolUse payload and checks
nothing on its own).

**Cross-cutting concerns:** Security, error handling, and QoS are not isolated to single
reference files — use your judgment and apply them whenever the data path crosses a
trust boundary, a node owns hardware, or communication reliability matters.

## Core engineering principles

These apply to every ROS 2 artifact you produce, regardless of domain.

### 1. Distro awareness

<!-- LAST_UPDATED: 2026-07-15 — Review this table every 6 months or when a new distro is released. -->
<!-- NEXT_REVIEW: 2027-01-15 -->
> **Staleness warning:** The table below was last verified on **2026-07-15**.
> If the current date is more than 6 months past that, re-verify EOL dates and
> feature support against https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html before
> relying on this table. When you update it, change both `LAST_UPDATED` and
> `NEXT_REVIEW` comments above.

Detect the distro before generating code — do not ask first, and do not
assume the newest release. Work down this ladder and stop at the first
answer:

1. **Active shell:** `echo $ROS_DISTRO` — the distro currently sourced.
   `ls /opt/ros/` is *inventory evidence* (what is installed), never an
   automatic selection.
2. **Workspace pin:** Dockerfile `FROM ros:<distro>`, CI matrix, `.repos`
   branch names — what the workspace intends to build and deploy against.
   (`package.xml` usually shows dependencies without naming a distro.)
3. **Installed versions:** `ros2 pkg xml <pkg>`, `dpkg-query -W 'ros-*'`
   (Principle 11) — this also settles behavior the distro label does not.
4. **Ask the user** when the workspace holds no evidence.
5. **Greenfield only:** default to the latest LTS.

**Conflict rule.** When active-shell evidence disagrees with the workspace
pin, report both and select neither silently. Prefer the workspace's
explicit build/deployment pin for guidance about the repository, and treat
the shell mismatch as an environment defect to resolve. Never resolve an
*existing* workspace to the newest LTS: that pulls API the installed stack
does not have. Key differences:

|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|

| ros2_control interface    | 2.x                | 4.x                | 5.x                | 6.x (verify installed) | Latest         |
| CMake recommendation      | ament_target_deps  | either             | target_link_libs   | target_link_libs   | target_link_libs   |

Foxy (EOL June 2023, Ubuntu 20.04, ros2_control not bundled) is a migration
reference only — see the migration notes below. The pre-Lyrical
`EventsExecutor` lives in the `rclcpp::experimental` namespace on every
release that ships it; Lyrical adds the separate, non-experimental
`rclcpp::executors::EventsCBGExecutor`.

For a greenfield project with no constraint, the latest LTS is **Lyrical Luth**
(Ubuntu 26.04); use **Jazzy** when the target platform is Ubuntu 24.04.
Pin the exact distro in Dockerfile, CI, and documentation so builds are reproducible.

### 2. C++ vs Python decision

Choose the language based on the node's role, not personal preference.
**rclcpp (C++)**: control loops ≥100 Hz, deterministic memory allocation
(real-time path), hardware drivers and controller plugins, intra-process
zero-copy. **rclpy (Python)**: orchestration, monitoring, parameter
management, rapid prototyping, Python-native ML frameworks — anything off
the latency-critical path.

**Mixed stacks are normal.** A typical robot has C++ drivers/controllers and Python
orchestration/monitoring. Note: `component_container` (composition) only loads
C++ components via pluginlib. Python nodes run as separate processes and
communicate over intra-host DDS — **not zero-overhead by default**: the
standard inter-process transport pays serialization, copies, and transport
bandwidth, and splitting work into another process does not by itself remove
encoding costs. Copy avoidance has three distinct mechanisms with different
preconditions: (1) the rclcpp **intra-process** path
(`use_intra_process_comms(true)`, same process) avoids copies only depending
on publish ownership (`unique_ptr`), callback type, subscriber count, and
QoS; (2) **loaned messages / vendor shared memory (SHM/PSMX)** are RMW- and
vendor-dependent and can avoid some or all copies when their preconditions
hold; (3) separate processes on the standard DDS transport get no copy
avoidance — crossing processes without copies requires the vendor
mechanisms in (2). Details: `references/nodes-executors.md`.

### 3. Package structure conventions

Follow the standard layout — `package.xml` (format 3, explicit `<depend>`
tags), `config/params.yaml`, `launch/*.launch.py`, `src/` +
`include/<pkg>/` for C++ or `<pkg>/` for Python, and `test/`. Keep custom
msg/srv/action definitions in a dedicated `*_interfaces` package so
downstream packages can depend on interfaces without the implementation.
Full annotated layout: `references/workspace-build.md`.

### 4. Parameter discipline

- Declare every parameter with a type, description, range, and default
  in the node constructor — never use undeclared parameters.
- Use `ParameterDescriptor` with `FloatingPointRange` or `IntegerRange`
  for numeric bounds. The parameter server rejects out-of-range values at set time.
- Group related parameters under a namespace prefix:
  `controller.kp`, `controller.ki`, `controller.kd`.
- Load defaults from a `config/params.yaml`; allow launch-time overrides.
- For dynamic reconfiguration, register a `set_parameters_callback` and
  validate new values atomically before accepting.

### 5. Error handling philosophy

- Nodes must not silently swallow errors. Log at the appropriate severity,
  then take a safe action (stop motion, request help, transition to error state).
- Prefer lifecycle node error transitions over ad-hoc boolean flags.
- When calling a service, always handle the "service not available" and
  "future timed out" cases explicitly.
- For hardware drivers, distinguish transient errors (retry with backoff)
  from fatal errors (transition to `FINALIZED` and alert the operator).

### 6. Quality of Service defaults

Start from these profiles and adjust per use case:

| Use case              | Reliability   | Durability       | History | Depth | Deadline    | Lifespan    |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Sensor stream         | BEST_EFFORT   | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 5   | —           | —           |
| Command velocity      | RELIABLE      | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 1   | 100 ms      | 200 ms      |
| Map (latched)         | RELIABLE      | TRANSIENT_LOCAL  | KEEP_LAST | 1   | —           | —           |
| Diagnostics           | RELIABLE      | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 10  | —           | —           |
| Parameter events      | RELIABLE      | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 1000| —           | —           |
| Action feedback       | RELIABLE      | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 1   | —           | —           |
| Safety heartbeat      | RELIABLE      | VOLATILE         | KEEP_LAST | 1   | 500 ms      | 1 s         |

These rows are **starting points, not verdicts**. The sensor row matches
`rmw_qos_profile_sensor_data` (BEST_EFFORT, depth 5), which fits a
high-rate stream whose consumer only wants the newest sample — but depth
follows the consumer's tolerance for staleness and its processing time,
and a sensor whose loss the system cannot detect (a safety-relevant scan,
a one-shot calibration) belongs on RELIABLE. Decide per data path, then
record why.

QoS mismatches are the #1 cause of "I published but nobody receives."
Always check compatibility with `ros2 topic info -v` when debugging.
Matching QoS is necessary for communication, but compatibility alone does
not prove that the delivered data is timely, semantically valid, or safe to
act on (Principle 13).

**DEADLINE and LIFESPAN** are critical for safety-critical systems. DEADLINE fires an
event when no message arrives within the specified period (detect stale data). LIFESPAN
discards messages older than the specified duration before delivery (prevent acting on
stale data). See `references/communication.md` section 9 for full API and examples.

### 7. Naming conventions

| Entity      | Convention                  | Example                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Package     | `snake_case`                | `arm_controller`               |
| Node        | `snake_case`                | `joint_state_broadcaster`      |
| Topic       | `/snake_case` with ns       | `/arm/joint_states`            |
| Service     | `/snake_case`               | `/arm/set_mode`                |
| Action      | `/snake_case`               | `/arm/follow_joint_trajectory` |
| Parameter   | `snake_case` with dot ns    | `controller.publish_rate`      |
| Frame       | `snake_case`                | `base_link`, `camera_optical`  |
| Interface   | `PascalCase.msg/srv/action` | `JointState.msg`               |

### 8. Thread safety and callbacks

- A `MutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup` serializes its callbacks — safe for
  shared state without locks, but limits throughput.
- A `ReentrantCallbackGroup` allows parallel execution — you must protect
  shared state with `std::mutex` (C++) or `threading.Lock` (Python).
- **Calling a service from a callback:** If the callback registers the
  request asynchronously — rclcpp: `async_send_request(request, response_callback)`;
  rclpy: `future = client.call_async(request)` then
  `future.add_done_callback(...)` — and **returns without waiting for the
  result**, the same `MutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup` does not deadlock.
  Deadlock comes from **waiting synchronously inside the callback** —
  rclcpp: calling `get()`/`wait()`/`wait_for()` on a **not-yet-complete**
  future from the initiating callback, or `spin_until_future_complete`
  (inside the response callback the future is already complete, so `get()`
  there is safe — the examples use exactly that); rclpy: synchronous
  `Client.call()`, `spin_until_future_complete`, or a loop that blocks
  until `future.done()`. (rclpy's `future.result()` by itself does not
  block — it immediately returns whatever result is currently stored,
  which may be unset.) A synchronous wait needs the
  client in a different callback group or a `ReentrantCallbackGroup`, plus
  a matching executor configuration (e.g. `MultiThreadedExecutor`). Do not assume plain-executor
  `async def` callback patterns are safe until tested with your executor;
  Lyrical's `rclpy.experimental.AsyncNode` is a separate execution model
  that officially supports `await client.call(...)` inside callbacks.
- Never do blocking work (file I/O, long computation, `sleep`) inside a
  timer or subscription callback on the default executor. Offload to a
  dedicated thread or use a `MultiThreadedExecutor` with a reentrant group.
- In rclcpp, prefer `std::shared_ptr<const MessageT>` in subscription
  callbacks to avoid unnecessary copies; whether intra-process delivery is
  actually copy-free additionally depends on publish ownership, subscriber
  count, and QoS (Principle 2).

### 9. Lifecycle-first design

Default to lifecycle (managed) nodes for anything that owns resources:
hardware drivers, sensor pipelines, planners, controllers. The managed
state machine (`unconfigured → inactive → active`, with `cleanup`,
`shutdown`, and error transitions) gives the system manager explicit
control over when resources are allocated, when processing starts, and how
shutdown proceeds — and makes error recovery predictable. Configure-only
transitions also enable hardware-safe config validation
(`references/testing.md` section 4). Full state diagram and callbacks:
`references/lifecycle-components.md`.

A plain node is the right call when nothing external is at stake or the
managed state machine cannot be honored: leaf compute nodes that own no
device, file handle, or actuator; nodes whose start/stop is already
sequenced by an outer supervisor; third-party nodes you do not control;
and rclc/micro-ROS targets with limited lifecycle support. Lifecycle is
not free — every managed node needs something to manage it, and adds
transition-failure states the system must handle.

### 10. Build and CI hygiene

- Use `colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` for
  development; `Release` for deployment.
- Enable `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` and treat warnings as errors in CI.
- Run `colcon test` with `--event-handlers console_cohesion+` so test
  output groups by package.
- Pin rosdep keys in `rosdep.yaml` for reproducible dependency resolution.
- Prefer compiler caches and dependency/container layers **that have explicit,
  reproducible invalidation inputs** — `.ccache/`, apt/rosdep, base images. They
  are not automatically safe either: an apt layer goes stale with the distro,
  repository state, dependency declarations, and package-index time, so key it
  on those.
- **Do not cache `build/`/`install/` by default.** Opt in only with an exact key
  covering toolchain, ROS distro, dependency resolution, build options, and the
  complete relevant source tree — and never partially restore them
  (`restore-keys` falls back to an older prefix match, which is exactly the
  failure). A partially restored install space keeps artifacts of files no
  longer in the source, so CI links and tests stale code and reports it green —
  the same stale-overlay failure that bites on robots
  (`references/runtime-provenance.md`).

### 11. Source-first behavior verification

Distro labels are not enough when exact behavior matters — patch releases
change parameter names, plugin behavior, and defaults. Before asserting how
an installed stack behaves, identify the installed version (`ros2 pkg xml`,
`dpkg-query -W`) and read what ships with it: reference configs, headers,
and the source tag matching that version. Worked Nav2 procedure:
`references/navigation.md` section 6.

### 12. Motion-safety defaults

Never generate configs that can move an unvalidated robot. Motion
recoveries (Spin/BackUp) stay opt-in until robot geometry, locomotion
response, and clearance are validated — actuation-free recovery comes
first. Velocity limits come from the safe operational ceiling, never the
SDK/API maximum. For hardware checks, prefer configure-only lifecycle
validation with hardware isolation (`references/testing.md` section 4).
Details: `references/navigation.md` sections 7 and 10.

**A stop command is verified end-to-end, not on a topic.** Zero velocity
visible on `/cmd_vel` proves a message was published — not that the robot
stopped. Verify all four links: command ownership, driver translation,
local submission plus any available remote-acceptance evidence, and
measured hardware response (`references/safety-estop.md` section 3).

### 13. Verification levels

Say which level a result came from, every time. Each level answers a
different question, and a claim never inherits the confidence of a level
it did not reach.

| Level | What ran | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | Static review | The code/config reads correctly; nothing was executed |
| L1 | Unit tests | Isolated logic, no ROS graph, no real time |
| L2 | Build + launch smoke | It compiles, nodes start, plugins/params load |
| L3 | Runtime, robot disconnected | Graph, QoS, TF and rates on sim or mock hardware |
| L4 | Hardware powered, no actuation | Real provenance, params, TF and driver state — motors disabled/isolated |
| L5 | Bench motion / fault injection | Commanded motion and failsafes on a restrained platform, operator present |
| L6 | Supervised field operation | The behavior in its real duty cycle |

Never write an L0–L2 result in L4+ language. "Tests pass" and "safe to
drive" may not share a sentence. When a level was skipped, say which one
and why. Level definitions and required evidence: `references/testing.md`
section 11.

## Common anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Global variables for node state | Breaks composition, untestable | Store state as class members |
| `spin(node)` in `main()` for a multi-node process | `spin(node)` creates an executor for **that node only**; other locally created nodes not added to another spinning executor receive no executor-driven callbacks (omission, not starvation) | Add every node to one executor; `MultiThreadedExecutor` only when callbacks must overlap, or use component composition |
| Hardcoded topic names | Breaks reuse across robots | Use relative names + namespace remapping |
| `KEEP_ALL` history with no bound | Memory grows unbounded on slow subscribers | Use `KEEP_LAST` with explicit depth |
| Using `time.sleep()` / `std::this_thread::sleep_for` | Blocks the executor thread | Use `create_wall_timer` or a dedicated thread |
| Monolithic launch file for everything | Unmanageable past 10 nodes | Compose launch files with `IncludeLaunchDescription` |
| Skipping `package.xml` dependencies | Builds locally, breaks CI and Docker | Declare every dependency explicitly |
| Publishing a one-shot VOLATILE message in the constructor and expecting later-matching subscribers to receive it | Subscribers that match afterwards never see it — publishing itself is fine, relying on delivery is not | Publish after discovery/activation when delivery matters, or use compatible `TRANSIENT_LOCAL` durability for state intentionally retained for late joiners (retained samples still require a live publisher and a compatible subscriber QoS) |
| Ignoring QoS compatibility | Silent communication failure | Match publisher/subscriber QoS or check with `ros2 topic info -v` |
| Creating timers/subs in callbacks | Resource leak, unpredictable behavior | Create all entities in constructor or `on_configure` |
| Synchronous service call in callback | Deadlocks the executor thread | Use `async_send_request` with a callback or dedicated thread |
| Waiting on a service future inside a callback | Synchronous waiting deadlocks a `MutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup`; registering a response callback and returning is safe even in the same group | Return without waiting; if a synchronous wait is unavoidable, put the client in a different group (or reentrant) with a `MultiThreadedExecutor` |
| No safe command on shutdown | Motors hold last velocity after node exits | Send zero-velocity in `on_deactivate` and the destructor as best-effort hygiene; crash safety needs a downstream command timeout/watchdog (`references/safety-estop.md`) |
| Dynamic subscriptions with `StaticSingleThreadedExecutor` | New subs are never picked up after `spin()` | Use `SingleThreadedExecutor` or `MultiThreadedExecutor` for dynamic entities |
| CPU frequency governor left on `powersave`/`ondemand` | 10-100 ms latency spikes in RT path | Set `performance` governor, disable turbo boost (see `references/realtime.md`) |

## AI pitfalls — traps this skill has learned from

These are mistakes AI agents repeatedly make when generating ROS 2 code.
**Add a new line here every time a failure is discovered in practice.**

| # | Pitfall | What goes wrong | Correct approach |
|---|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Using `spin_until_future_complete` inside a callback | Deadlocks the executor — the callback blocks waiting for a response that can never be delivered | Register a response callback and return without waiting; a separate callback group (or reentrant + `MultiThreadedExecutor`) is needed only when a synchronous wait is unavoidable |
| 2 | Generating Foxy-era API for Jazzy/Kilted | `node_executable` is deprecated, `export_state_interfaces()` signature changed in ros2_control 4.x | Detect the distro from the environment and workspace first (Principle 1) — never default an existing workspace to the newest LTS — then check the feature matrix above |
| 3 | Omitting QoS in publisher/subscriber creation | Defaults silently mismatch — publisher sends but subscriber receives nothing | Always specify QoS explicitly; use the QoS defaults table in Principle 6 |
| 4 | Creating a `msg/` directory inside a non-interfaces package | Builds locally but fails in CI — interface packages need `rosidl_generate_interfaces` | Put messages in a dedicated `*_interfaces` package |
| 5 | Hardcoding `/opt/ros/humble/` paths in launch files | Breaks on any other distro or install prefix | Use `FindPackageShare`, `PathJoinSubstitution`, or environment substitutions |
| 6 | Forgetting `<depend>` tags in `package.xml` | `colcon build` works in overlay but `rosdep install` and Docker builds fail | Declare every `find_package()` / `import` as `<depend>` in package.xml |
| 7 | Using `time.sleep()` for rate control in rclpy | Blocks the executor thread; timers and subscriptions stop firing | Use `create_timer()` or `Rate` with a `MultiThreadedExecutor` |
| 8 | Treating process-side cleanup as crash safety | Destructors never run on SIGKILL/power loss and are not guaranteed on segfaults — the robot keeps its last command | Zero-command in `on_deactivate` + destructor is best-effort hygiene only; require a downstream command timeout, heartbeat/watchdog, and hardware e-stop (`references/safety-estop.md`) |
| 9 | Mixing `ament_target_dependencies()` and `target_link_libraries()` | Kilted deprecated `ament_target_dependencies` — mixing causes link errors | Use `target_link_libraries()` with modern CMake targets for Kilted+; `ament_target_dependencies()` for Humble/Jazzy |
| 10 | Generating `rospy` / `roscpp` code instead of `rclpy` / `rclcpp` | ROS 1 patterns in a ROS 2 context — nothing compiles | This skill is ROS 2 only — always use `rclpy`/`rclcpp` APIs |
| 11 | Ignoring `use_sim_time` parameter in simulation | Real clock diverges from Gazebo clock — tf lookups fail, controllers drift | Set `use_sim_time:=true` in launch and pass `--clock` to `ros2 bag play` |
| 12 | Publishing before subscribers connect (no TRANSIENT_LOCAL) | First N messages lost — map, URDF, or initial config never received | Use `TRANSIENT_LOCAL` durability for latched-style data, or publish in `on_activate` with a startup delay |
| 13 | Writing Nav2 names from memory (`recoveries_server`/`nav2_recoveries/` on Humble, pre-Galactic `default_bt_xml_filename`) | Parameters silently ignored or plugin loading fails at configure | Humble+ uses `behavior_server`/`nav2_behaviors/` and `default_nav_to_pose_bt_xml`; verify against the installed version (Principle 11) |
| 14 | Enabling Spin/BackUp recoveries by default on an unvalidated robot | Robot suddenly rotates or reverses in the field — the recovery, not path following, is at fault | Motion recoveries are opt-in after validation; actuation-free recovery first (Principle 12) |
| 15 | Reading zero Twist on the command topic as "the robot stopped" | The driver may discard a zero command as "no command", or a competing publisher's next command may take effect immediately afterwards — the message was published, the robot never stopped | Verify the whole chain: single arbiter → driver's actual stop call → submission/acceptance evidence → measured hardware response (`references/safety-estop.md` §3) |
| 16 | Reading the YAML in `src/` and assuming that is what runs | The process loaded an installed copy from some prefix; an older `install/`, a second overlay, or a launch-time override wins silently | Diff source against `$(ros2 pkg prefix <pkg>)/share/...`, then confirm with `ros2 param dump` on the live node (`references/runtime-provenance.md`) |
| 17 | Guessing array-field semantics from the field name or index | Joint order, covariance layout, and `ranges` indexing are publisher-defined — a guessed index silently reads the wrong joint or axis | Read the message definition *and* the publisher's actual ordering (e.g. `JointState.name`); never index by assumption (`references/message-types.md`) |
| 18 | Checking that a TF chain connects and stopping there | A connected chain can still be stale, or driven by two broadcasters fighting over one edge — the lookup succeeds and the pose is wrong | Also enumerate the `/tf` publisher endpoints (`ros2 topic info /tf -v`), treat `TF_REPEATED_DATA` as a duplicate-broadcaster clue, and check timestamp freshness (`references/runtime-provenance.md`) |
| 19 | Reporting a passing test suite as hardware verification | Static and unit results get written in the language of field validation, so nobody knows what was actually tried on the robot | State the verification level with every claim (Principle 13); "tests pass" and "safe to drive" are different levels |
| 20 | Treating Nav2's low output velocity as a config bug | The command may be correct and simply below the robot's actuation-onset threshold — retuning Nav2 cannot fix a command the hardware ignores | Measure the smallest command that produces real motion first, then set limits from it (`references/navigation.md` §10) |
| 21 | Putting a deadband inside an open-loop smoother's feedback path | The zeroed output is fed back as the new state, so each tick's ramp increment is erased and the robot never accelerates | Feed back the pre-deadband value and apply the deadband only to the published output (upstream `nav2_velocity_smoother` assigns `last_cmd_` before zeroing) |
| 22 | Treating node/topic presence as evidence the system is healthy | The CLI node listing can echo a stale daemon cache, and ROS 2 permits duplicate node names — two live processes answer as one | Cross-check with `--no-daemon` (or restart the daemon) and `pgrep -af` against the real processes (`references/runtime-provenance.md`) |

## Distro-specific migration notes

<!-- LAST_UPDATED: 2026-03-30 — Keep in sync with the distro table in Principle 1. -->
When upgrading between distributions, check these breaking changes first:

- **Foxy → Humble:** complete API overhaul (lifecycle, actions stabilized in Humble);
  `ros2_control` was not bundled in Foxy; Nav2 renamed `recoveries_server` →
  `behavior_server` and `nav2_recoveries/` → `nav2_behaviors/` (Galactic → Humble
  migration — pre-Humble recovery naming does not exist on Humble). Plan a rework,
  not a port.
- **Humble → Jazzy:** `ros2_control` 2.x → 4.x — interface exports auto-generated,
  `get_value()` → `get_optional<T>()`, spawner uses `--param-file`, all `<ros2_control>`
  joints must exist in the URDF (details: `references/hardware-interface.md`); default
  bag format sqlite3 → **MCAP** (`storage_id='mcap'`); `ROS_AUTOMATIC_DISCOVERY_RANGE`
  replaces `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY`; `launch_ros` parameter handling changed — retest
  launch files.
- **Jazzy → Kilted (non-LTS):** Zenoh Tier 1 (`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp`);
  experimental EventsExecutor gains an rclpy port (still `rclcpp::experimental`);
  `ament_target_dependencies()` deprecated — use `target_link_libraries()` with modern
  CMake targets; Gazebo pairing is **Ionic** (Harmonic was Jazzy); multi-bag replay in
  `ros2 bag play`.
- **Kilted → Lyrical (LTS):** primary platform moves to Ubuntu 26.04; default RMW
  stays `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`; new non-experimental `rclcpp::executors::EventsCBGExecutor`
  (distinct from the experimental EventsExecutor); ros2_control moves to the 6.x
  series — verify per-package changes against the installed versions (Principle 11).
- **ROS 1 → ROS 2:** see `references/migration-ros1.md` for a step-by-step strategy.
