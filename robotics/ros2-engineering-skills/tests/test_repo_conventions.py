"""Tests for the repository's own tooling (.claude/hooks), not the skill.

The commit-attribution guard is a write-path gate: a false negative lets a
tool-attribution trailer into permanent history, and a false positive
blocks legitimate commits. It rejected its own introducing commit the
first time it ran — the message described the banned trailers, and the
patterns matched anywhere rather than at a line start — so both directions
are pinned here.
