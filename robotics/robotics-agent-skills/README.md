# 🤖 Robotics Agent Skills

Production-grade robotics knowledge for AI coding agents.

Drop these `SKILL.md` files into Claude Code, Autohand Code, Cursor, Copilot-style
agents, or custom agent frameworks to make them generate better ROS1/ROS2 software:
safer nodes, correct QoS, lifecycle patterns, tests, launch files, Docker, bringup,
perception, and security.

## Why This Exists

General-purpose coding agents know ROS syntax, but they often miss the robotics details
that matter in production: QoS compatibility, deterministic startup, bounded callbacks,
sensor health checks, safe shutdown, launch ergonomics, and testability.

This repo is the missing robotics engineering layer for AI coding agents.

## Evidence: Same Prompt, With and Without Skills

The `evals/` directory compares the same ROS2 package prompt run once with no skills and
once with the robotics skills loaded as context.

| Result | Without Skills | With Skills |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Node architecture | Plain `rclpy.Node`; setup in constructor | Lifecycle node with configure/activate/deactivate/cleanup/shutdown |
| Sensor QoS | Default depth 10 for everything | Sensor QoS for camera/joints, reliable QoS for status |
| Sensor handling | Latest-message assignment | Thread-safe bounded buffers, drop counts, watchdogs |
| Timestamp sync | None | Sync offset checks and dropped-frame accounting |
| Tests | 0 lines | 601 lines |
| Structure | Single node module | Separate writer module and cleaner responsibilities |
| Config surface | 4 parameters | 13 parameters |

## Quick Start

Install selected skills into a project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpitg1304/robotics-agent-skills.git
cd robotics-agent-skills
./install.sh --target /path/to/your/robot/.claude/skills --skills ros2 robotics-testing robot-bringup
```

For Autohand Code project skills:

```bash
./install.sh --target /path/to/your/robot/.autohand/skills --skills ros2 robotics-testing robot-bringup
```

Or copy manually:

```bash
cp -R skills/ros2 /path/to/your/robot/.claude/skills/
cp -R skills/robotics-testing /path/to/your/robot/.claude/skills/
```

## How Agents Use These Skills

### Claude Code

Copy or symlink the skills you need into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory.
Claude Code auto-discovers `SKILL.md` files and triggers them based on the YAML
`description` field.

### Autohand Code

Copy or symlink the skills you need into your project's `.autohand/skills/`
directory. User-level skills live under `~/.autohand/skills/`; project-level
skills live under `<project>/.autohand/skills/`.

### Claude Projects

Place the skill directories in your project's `/mnt/skills/user/` directory.

### Custom Agent Frameworks

Load the relevant `SKILL.md` as system-prompt context when a task matches the skill:

```python
from pathlib import Path

SKILLS = {
    "ros2": "skills/ros2/SKILL.md",
    "testing": "skills/robotics-testing/SKILL.md",
    "perception": "skills/robot-perception/SKILL.md",
    "bringup": "skills/robot-bringup/SKILL.md",
    "security": "skills/robotics-security/SKILL.md",
}

def load_skill(task_description: str) -> str:
    text = task_description.lower()
    for trigger, path in SKILLS.items():
        if trigger in text:
            return Path(path).read_text()
    return ""
```

## What Good Skills Contain

- Specific trigger descriptions so agents know when to load them.
- Working examples, not just prose.
- Robotics failure modes: QoS mismatches, stale transforms, unsafe shutdown, blocking callbacks.
- Production defaults: bounded queues, lifecycle management, observability, tests.
- Anti-patterns that show what to avoid.
