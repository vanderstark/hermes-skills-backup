//! `maestro conflict`: assert (or `--clear`) a link-free "I am taking this
//! ground, hold off" notice aimed at a peer card, and the ambient `[CONFLICT]`
//! banner that surfaces it on the peer's next command.
//!
//! The verb never writes a link edge and never runs git -- a notice is a
//! transient coordination signal, persisted by the `conflict` store and read
//! cross-worktree via its union (`domain::conflict`). Visibility is
//! liveness-scoped: the banner shows a notice only while its asserter is a
//! non-stale session in the active union and the asserting card is not terminal
//! (`dec-conflict-notice-lifetime-scoped-to-c5eb`). The peer never has to erase
//! someone else's notice; it fades when the asserter clears it, finishes its
//! card, or falls out of the live union.
