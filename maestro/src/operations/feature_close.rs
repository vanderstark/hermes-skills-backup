//! Feature close coordinator: the full `stack.verify` suite backstop at the close gate.
//!
//! decision-002 pairs the per-task narrow falsifier at task-verify with a full
//! repo-global `stack.verify` run at `feature close`. The suite is a close ACTION,
//! not an evidence gap: it must run only on a REAL close (after the evidence gaps
//! pass), never on `--dry-run`, `maestro status`, or the verify handoff. The
//! feature domain owns the evidence gate; this operation layers the suite run on
//! top so the feature aggregate never reaches into proof's command runner.
