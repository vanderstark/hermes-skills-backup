//! Cross-session serialization of the full-suite close gate (decision
//! `dec-heavy-run-serialization-lock-only-6a17`).
//!
//! Two maestro sessions that each launch the repo-global `stack.verify` suite
//! would run two heavy test/build jobs at once and lag the user's machine. The
//! gate lock makes that suite one-at-a-time: a second run waits on an advisory
//! `flock` over a single lockfile in the Git common dir -- shared across every
//! worktree -- then proceeds the moment the holder finishes. The lock lives on an
//! open file descriptor, so the kernel releases it if the holder crashes; there
//! is deliberately no heartbeat and no stale-reclaim path. The holder writes its
//! session id into the file so a waiting run, `maestro active`, and the
//! pre-command banner can name who is busy.
//!
//! Only the close-gate full suite is serialized. The per-task narrow falsifier is
//! not -- concurrent slice verifications must stay independent.
