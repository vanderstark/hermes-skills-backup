//! The chat-channel store: pull-only, file-backed messaging. A channel is either
//! a two-card pair that shares a `related` edge, or a feature-scoped broadcast
//! every card under a feature shares (no `related` edge required). This module is
//! pure persistence and queries -- the link/membership gate, visibility,
//! transport selection, and rendering live in the `msg` verbs and the inbox
//! banner. The ordinary channel is pull-only: a peer's local message is seen
//! only when the other agent reads it. Transport-specific delivery receipts live
//! beside the channel without becoming unread inbox items.
//!
//! On-disk shape under `.maestro/channels/` (gitignored, machine-local):
//!   `<key>.jsonl`         line 1 = `{"pair":[a,b]}` (two-card) or `{"feature":id}`
//!                         (feature broadcast) header (authoritative),
//!                         lines 2.. = `{id,ts,from_card,from_session,text}`.
//!   `delivery/<key>.jsonl` line 1 = `{"schema_version":"maestro.channel-delivery.v1",
//!                         "pair":[a,b]}`, lines 2.. = delivery receipts.
//!   `<key>.cur-<cardkey>` the viewer's read-through cursor: the newest seen ts
//!                         plus exact message ids at that ts. Legacy bare-ts
//!                         cursors still read as timestamp-only cursors.
//!
//! `key` is a short hash of the sorted lowercased id pair (two-card) or of
//! `feature\n<id>` (broadcast), so every member derives the same channel;
//! `cardkey` is a short hash of the viewer's card id, so the cursor survives a
//! title rename (ids are stable, titles are not).
//!
//! A send always writes the running worktree's own channel file
//! (`open_managed_appendable` cannot escape the local repo root). The union
//! reads -- `load_union`/`channels_for_union` -- merge every worktree's file for
//! a pair by ts; because a message lives in exactly one worktree's file there is
//! nothing to dedup, only to interleave.
