//! Extraction of the bundled harness protocol into `.maestro/harness/`.
//!
//! `HARNESS.md` is the agent-facing protocol Maestro ships. It rides the shared
//! version-gated extraction core alongside the hook script: a `version:` field
//! in its Markdown frontmatter plays the same role `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter
//! plays for skills, so local edits survive `maestro upgrade` until the shipped
//! version changes. Harness and skills share the Markdown `version:` convention,
//! so the harness gate reuses the skills frontmatter reader.
