# Maestro Card

Maestro uses three work levels: High = Card, Mid = CardKind / workflow kind,
and Low = Task. Feature, Bug, Chore, Custom, Decision, Idea, and Progress are
CardKinds, not separate high-level objects. Progress is a lightweight CardKind
that stores many low Tasks in `progress.yml`; legacy `type: task` cards remain
readable for compatibility. This skill covers the active-work cluster: the task
work loop, card/feature lifecycle, proof, and QA gates. Design
(`maestro-design`), audit (`maestro-audit`), and setup (`maestro-setup`) have
their own skills.

Activate with a known session id:
`maestro hook record --event skill_activation --skill maestro-card --session <session_id>`

First step in a session: run `maestro active` (pull-only) to see what other
live sessions are working on before you claim. If a peer is on a related card,
connect yours with `maestro link add <your-card> <their-card>`; maestro never
auto-links. Once linked, coordinate through the channel: `maestro msg send
<their-card> "<text>"` and `maestro msg read`. An `[inbox] N new (...) ->
maestro msg read` line on STDERR before any command means a linked peer is
waiting -- clear it with `maestro msg read` (see [reference/work.md](reference/work.md)).
Inbox messages are advisory coordination only: they can suggest an ordering
relationship, but they do not block work. Record an explicit Task blocker when
execution order matters. Reply when the message poses a question or needs a
decision; an FYI needs no reply.

Phase 0: design-to-card gate. Before `task setup`, `feature prepare`, source
edits, implementation tests, or other work verbs, ask:

- Am I coming from design or brainstorm?
- What card/feature owns this work?
- Is that card/feature handoff finalized and fresh?

If the answer starts in design and the owning card/feature or fresh handoff is
missing, stop. Bind chat-only or standalone Decision records to a Feature/card
contract and refresh/finalize the handoff through the supported feature
lifecycle path first. Progress rows cannot be used to implicitly end design.
If the design approval included "lock all", "all rec", or all-recommendations
decisions, confirm they landed as a DecisionSet or separate child decisions. Do
not build on a compressed summary lock; run `maestro decision audit --compressed`
and route repair through `maestro decision set repair` or back to
`maestro-design`.

When you start implementation, apply the session-owned main fast path first:
if only your session is fresh, and dirty paths are current-session Maestro state
or unrelated files you will not touch, stay on main. Worktree-isolate only for
a fresh non-self same-card/path overlap, unknown source/test dirt,
release/install clean-tree proof, or explicit user isolation. If you split,
follow the conflict-handoff protocol in HARNESS.md: link + `maestro conflict`
on a file you will share, merge back then `--clear`. The full dance (including
a conflicted merge-back) is `maestro loop show conflict-handoff`.

Recipe checkpoint: Maestro's main workflow is the loop. Use `maestro status`
for current state, `maestro loop next` as the read-only router when the next
recipe is not obvious, and `maestro loop show <recipe>` for the selected
lifecycle grammar. Use `maestro loop show work` for task/card implementation,
`maestro loop show ship` before close/release/archive gates,
`maestro loop show unattended` for away-mode autonomy, and
`maestro loop show learning` when recording reusable lessons. Writes still use
the existing Maestro verbs named by the recipe. Rule: loop next recommends;
outcome/proof/memory verbs write. Use `maestro loop next --chain` to explain
current chain position without writing, `maestro loop outcome` to append
structured attempt outcomes and transition receipts after native work,
`maestro loop trace <card>` to audit card-scoped receipts, and `maestro loop
improve` for read-only improvement proposals whose apply commands must be run
explicitly. Do not use hidden stores, hidden schedulers, silent recipe mutation,
or proof/QA bypass. Custom card/run recipes are
allowed only when no shipped recipe fits, and must keep the same six phases,
current Maestro verbs, hard stops, and continue output. Work Lease is only a
choose-phase helper; it may select or reserve one safe unit, but it is not a
scheduler, daemon, queue, worker launcher, executor, hidden store, or second
lifecycle.
Loop readiness is an evidence gate. For production loop patterns or any
unattended/away-mode claim, read `maestro loop validate <pattern>` and
`maestro status`; report the effective L0/L1/L2/L3 level, gaps, operating-limit
sources, scheduler stance, liveness, and `blocked_from_next_level`. Do not
claim L3 or use unattended wording unless the readouts say L3 and no blockers
remain. External schedulers stay external; Maestro stays passive/local-first.

## Route

Pick one branch, read its reference, then apply the shared ground rules below.
Load extra references only when the chosen branch points at them.

- Pick up, progress, finish, or unblock executable Tasks:
  [reference/work.md](reference/work.md). Its implement step is test-first
  (red-green-refactor) whenever the task's `--check` names observable
  behavior: [reference/tdd.md](reference/tdd.md).
- Track simple work with the low-ceremony Task surface (`task setup` or `task
  add` -> `task start` -> `task done`, no separate todo namespace): this
  creates or reuses a Progress card and stores low Tasks in `progress.yml`.
  Installed hooks block write-like tool use until a visible Progress checklist
  exists; see the "Simple Task Board" section of
  [reference/work.md](reference/work.md).
- Tidy a card's diff before proving it (quality cleanup, applied in place):
  [reference/simplify.md](reference/simplify.md). On a test-first card this is
  the red-green-refactor step, not a second pass.
- Work the backlog unattended, including "use loop", "keep looping",
  "I am going away", "I am going to sleep", "work while I am away", or broad
  user goals that must first compile into Maestro records while the user is
  away or asleep:
  [reference/loop.md](reference/loop.md)
- Finalize, accept, prepare, amend, close, or archive a feature card after design:
  [reference/feature.md](reference/feature.md)
- Prove a claim, repair failed proof, or verify adversarially:
  [reference/verify.md](reference/verify.md)
- Capture the behavior contract before `feature accept`:
  [reference/qa-baseline.md](reference/qa-baseline.md)
- Replay scenarios and record slice evidence before `feature close`:
  [reference/qa-slice.md](reference/qa-slice.md)
- Intake an external spec, plan, or PRD after design approval:
  [reference/intake.md](reference/intake.md)

## Shared Ground

- Prefer native Maestro MCP tools for lifecycle reads and writes when the host
  exposes them. The host-loaded tool schema is authoritative. Use CLI commands
  when MCP is unavailable, for verbs not yet exposed as MCP tools, or when
  debugging unsupported behavior.
- Native harness layer work route: run `maestro intake` for settled external
  specs or plans before creating executable tasks; run `maestro capability`
  when work depends on optional tools, files, connectors, or host receipts; run
  `maestro maturity` before proof or close when context, acceptance, proof gaps,
  UX friction, maturity level, or next owner is unclear. Generated CLI
  references prove command shape; Harness and targeted skills teach the
  workflow.
- Exact command signatures live in [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md),
  generated from the binary. A verb or flag not listed there does not exist;
  read it instead of probing `--help`. CLI remains the compatibility and
  human-facing contract; MCP is the agent ergonomic contract.
- Discover executable work with `maestro task list`, `maestro task next`, and
  `maestro card list` for card-container context. Progress-backed low Tasks
  appear in task views as routine `REF` rows; use `task list --json` when you
  need stable ids. The Progress card itself appears in card views. Take and annotate tasks with
  `maestro task start`/`maestro task claim`, `maestro task update`, and
  `maestro task note`.
- Record implementation discoveries with `maestro task note <task-id> "<text>"`
  for decisions not in the handoff/spec. Record plan changes, tradeoffs, gotchas, risks, and follow-up work; use `maestro note <card-id>` only for card-store notes. Scope or acceptance changes still require Feature/Card contract amendment.
- Ids are stable and opaque (`card-<hash>`; features keep their creation
  slug). The dotted alias `show` prints is display-only; never address a card
  with it.
- Never chain a guessed id: use only refs read from `task list` for immediate
  Task subcommands, or ids read from verb output (`task add --id-only`, `task
  list --json`, `card list`, `card show`). When a lookup misses, re-list and
  read the real id; do not retry spelling variations.
- Do not hand-edit `card.yaml` or the verb-guarded sidecars (`qa.md`,
  state history). Use verbs so gates and audit trails stay intact.
- Terminal words are per type — feature `closed`/`cancelled`, task
  `verified`/`rejected`/`abandoned`/`superseded`, decision
  `locked`/`superseded`, and Bug/Chore/Custom card containers `closed` after
  owned tasks verify — and all of them read as coarse `closed` on the board.
  `maestro card close` fits only legacy task cards or task-owning
  Bug/Chore/Custom containers whose owned tasks are verified.
  When the user says "close" a feature, branch on its state: a live feature
  means `feature close` or `feature cancel`; a feature already terminal
  (closed/cancelled) means archive it. If the current request, accepted
  contract, SPEC, or run record grants bounded ship or auto-archive authority
  for this target, do not finish at "closed" and do not ask again: after the
  requested push/publish/release/local-install/handoff boundary completes and
  the delivered commit hash is known, run `maestro feature auto-archive <id>`
  as the next lifecycle step. If no such authority exists, run
  `maestro card archive <id>` only when the user's terminal "close" wording is
  explicit archive intent. Archive is never a blind close/cancel side effect,
  and a non-terminal feature is never archived.
- For preauthorized auto-archive, use `maestro feature auto-archive <id>` with
  a current target-scoped authority (`--authority-ref`, `--authority-target`,
  `--authority-head`, `--authority-state current`), exact QA evidence
  (`--tested-head`, `--qa-result pass`, repeat `--qa-evidence`), the owning
  run/worktree disposition (`--run`, `--multi-agent`, `--worker-source`), and
  the current store that owns the target card
  (`--canonical-store <path-to-current/.maestro>`). A linked implementation
  worktree may auto-archive when its current `.maestro` store owns the target,
  the work is done, and evidence names the exact current `HEAD`. Stop instead of
  archiving if the helper refuses, if relevant worktree state is dirty, if
  worker changes are not represented in the current target `HEAD`, if the
  current store does not own the target card, if relevant Maestro conflicts are
  still asserted, or if terminal archive preflight fails.
- When the user corrects or steers active work, do not pause just because they
  corrected you. If the correction is clear, record it with `maestro event
  intervention --note "<what changed>" [--topic <slug>]` and apply it. If it is
  unclear but low-risk, state the assumption, record it, and continue. Ask only
  when the ambiguity can change scope, contract, schema, lifecycle, release
  behavior, or other hard-to-reverse work. Full routing lives in
  [reference/work.md](reference/work.md).
