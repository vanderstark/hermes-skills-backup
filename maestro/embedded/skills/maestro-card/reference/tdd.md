# Test-Driven Development

Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)
`skills/engineering/tdd` (MIT). The body is upstream's; only the planning
inputs and the evidence record are wired to the card store.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tdd/tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](tdd/mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, use the project's domain glossary so that test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Read the card: its locked `--check` and the feature's acceptance criteria are the behaviors to test
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](tdd/deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](tdd/interface-design.md)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)

**You can't test everything.** The card's check and acceptance criteria already say which behaviors matter most; do not re-ask the user. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](tdd/refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

On a maestro card this refactor step IS the simplify pass
([simplify.md](simplify.md)): one once-per-card cleanup, widened to the reuse,
altitude, and dead-code lenses. Do not run simplify again before `task
complete`.

## Checklist Per Cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```

## Evidence

The red→green record is the card's proof, recorded as two claims in
`task complete --claim/--proof` ([work.md](work.md) owns the verbs):

- one names the tracer test that failed RED before implementation
  (`RED: test_checkout_rejects_empty_cart failed before impl`)
- one names the GREEN suite result that followed
  (`GREEN: cargo test 41 passed, 0 failed`)

Both carry matching proof text per the evidence gate, so the proof shows
test-first on its face. The task handoff prints `implement_method: TDD
required` with `proof_required: RED claim + GREEN claim` when this applies. A
card that took the skip records one claim naming the locked or printed skip
reason instead.

## Hand-off

Next: all behaviors green and refactored -> finish the card per
[work.md](work.md); proof recorded -> [verify.md](verify.md).
