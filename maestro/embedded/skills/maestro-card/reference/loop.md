The away mode of the work loop: one long-lived session carries the current
work forward and works the card store until done while the human is away. Per
unit of work this file adds nothing - every card is claimed, worked, and
verified exactly per [work.md](work.md), including its test-first default. This
file is the full unattended policy authority: authorization, local
autonomy, replenishment, stops, audit ledger, boundaries, and the report.
Read or cite `maestro loop show unattended` first; it is the shipped lifecycle
recipe that maps this policy into perceive -> choose -> act -> observe -> learn
-> continue.

## Kickoff

The human says some form of "use loop", "keep looping", "I am going away",
"I am going to sleep", "work while I am away", or "work the backlog while I'm
away" and leaves. Carry forward the work they were on - continue the current
feature and its cards, do not abandon them for a fresh queue. In
full-autonomy mode the away prompt is the local authorization to finalize
clean handoffs, accept proposed contracts, prepare tasks, unblock local
Maestro blockers, add dependencies when covered by the accepted contract or
blocker authority, work, verify, commit locally, and close locally verified
features without another human response. No stop time or unit cap is required,
ever; if the prompt states one ("until 07:00", "max 5 cards"), honor it,
never ask for one.

Start from the store, never from memory (the session can die; the store is the
only durable state): `maestro status` for state, `maestro ready` for the
executable task-wave projection, and `maestro loop next` for read-only routing
when the next lifecycle is not obvious. `loop next` consumes the readiness graph
and chooses the lifecycle recipe: parallel work -> work, serial integration gate
-> work, ship gate -> ship, design gap -> design, conflict -> conflict-handoff.
Use `maestro loop next --chain` when you need to see the derived chain position,
transition trigger, next native command, and return conditions; it is still
read-only. Use `maestro loop outcome` after the native action to append any
transition receipt, and `maestro loop trace <card>` to audit card-scoped receipt
history. It is not a queue, scheduler, executor, or hidden gate loop. Use
`maestro loop work-lease --json` only when you are intentionally running the
legacy card-board choose-phase helper. Work Lease selects one ready card in the
requested scope, claims it through the normal card claim policy, emits the
existing work-touch run evidence, and prints the bounded worker contract. It
never launches a worker, sleeps, polls, owns a queue, schedules the next tick,
or becomes a second lifecycle.
Before calling a pattern or away workflow unattended, check native loop
readiness: `maestro loop validate <pattern>` and `maestro status` must show the
effective level, gaps, operating-limit sources, scheduler stance, liveness, and
`blocked_from_next_level`. L0/L1/L2 can still guide local work, but L3
unattended wording is allowed only when the readouts say L3 and no blockers
remain. External schedulers may fire ordinary sessions; Maestro itself never
becomes the scheduler or executor.

If the kickoff is a broad goal instead of a named card or accepted feature,
infer a minimal GoalBrief before work starts:

```text
GoalBrief:
  outcome
  stop_condition
  constraints
```

The GoalBrief is transient. It must compile immediately into existing Maestro
records:

- `outcome` -> proposed feature description/request, or the current accepted
  feature if the goal clearly continues already-accepted work
- `stop_condition` -> acceptance/check candidates and proof expectations
- `constraints` -> non-goals, boundaries, or decision context

Do not create a goal file, goal command, hidden planner state, schema, MCP
tool, daemon, scheduler, or separate goal lifecycle. Existing feature, task,
decision, proof, and QA gates remain the only durable contract.

For a new broad goal, draft or update a proposed feature, run
`feature reconcile` to write or refresh the pre-finalize receipt, then
`feature finalize` to write the clean handoff, then accept it locally when the
contract is explicit enough for Maestro's normal `feature accept` gate to pass.
For a goal already backed by proposed, ready, or current work, continue into the
card loop below. For an ambiguous broad goal, draft with explicit assumptions:
record what you inferred in the feature/spec, turn material uncertainty into
questions or decision forks, and hard stop only when even a proposed feature
would be materially misleading, permission-sensitive, or outside the hard-stop
boundary.

Codex can run the resulting card loop directly. Claude Code should author a
Workflow script that performs the same store-grounded sequence. Both agents use
the same records and stop conditions.

## Loop

1. Record `autonomy_start` before crossing local gates. It carries
   `authority_ref`, `authority_summary`, `prompt_hash`, and `hard_stops`.
   Authority is run-scoped: it ends on dry stop, hard stop, terminal report, or
   a stale/abandoned run. It is not a repo mode, card mode, config flag, daemon,
   or scheduler.
2. `maestro loop work-lease --json` -> read the returned `selected_card` and
   `worker_prompt` -> work the card per [work.md](work.md). The returned JSON
   includes the card id, claim identity, stale-claim policy, allowed follow-up
   verbs, hard stops, recurrence-guard requirement, `handles.inspect`,
   `handles.status`, `handles.reconcile`, run-event path, ship authority status,
   compact `approved_lessons` refs, and review-only `memory_suggestions` with
   create/dismiss commands.
   Approved Memory is context, not authority: use it as scoped guidance, but
   current user instructions, locked acceptance, Proof/QA, and run-scoped ship
   authority outrank it. Follow a lesson's `maestro memory show <id>` pointer
   only when it is relevant to the selected card. A Memory suggestion is a
   proposal, not authority: create it only with the printed `maestro memory
   create --from <id>` command when it is relevant, or dismiss it with the
     printed dismiss command. The test-first rule applies unchanged: an observable
     `--check` is worked test-first; a skip is valid only for a non-behavioral
     check or an explore/spike lane, and the skip note names which. Skips are
     surfaced in the report.
3. Finish with `task complete --summary --claim --proof`, then
   `maestro task verify <id>`.
4. Commit each verified slice locally on the feature branch. Never push.
5. When a local lifecycle gate is crossed because of away authorization, record
   an `autonomy_action` before or immediately after the command. Include
   `action`, `target_kind`, `target_id`, `authority_ref`, compact
   `before_state`, normalized/redacted `command`, `result`, and compact
   `after_state`. Do not store full card snapshots.
6. When `maestro ready` has no executable wave, serial gate, or blocked-next
   item you can resolve locally, replenish: find proposed or ready features that
   can proceed locally. For proposed features, satisfy the normal QA-baseline
   and accept gate; for ready features with no tasks, run
   `feature prepare <id> --draft`, review the draft, apply with
   `prepare --from`, and continue the loop.
7. A feature whose children are all verified may be closed locally when the
   normal QA-slice and `feature close` gates pass. Record the local close as an
   `autonomy_action`. This is local delivery only: no push, tag, release,
   publish, archive, or external announcement unless the original prompt or
   accepted card contract granted explicit run-scoped ship authority naming
   scope, target, allowed external actions, hard stops, and required evidence.
   When that authority includes bounded ship or auto-archive authority for the
   target, do not stop at `closed`: finish the authorized ship boundary, then run
   the archive cleanup without asking again. Archive additionally requires the
   kickoff, SPEC, or run policy to explicitly preauthorize auto-archive and
   `maestro feature auto-archive <id> --authority-ref <ref> --authority-target <id> --authority-head <sha> --authority-state current --tested-head <sha> --qa-result pass --qa-evidence "<proof>" --run <run> --multi-agent "<disposition>" --canonical-store <path-to/.maestro> --worker-source "<branch/worktree or none>"`
   to pass against the post-merge target `HEAD`. Absent, partial, stale, or
   overbroad authority fails closed.
8. When nothing is workable, acceptable, preparable, unblockable, or closable
   inside the hard-stop boundary, stop and write the report.

## Failure Budget

- A card that fails 3 attempts is not ground down:
  `maestro task block <id> --reason "<what failed, 3 attempts>"`, then take
  the next card.
- 3 consecutive blocked cards means the problem is systemic (broken build,
  bad assumption), not the cards. End the night early and say so in the
  report.

## Boundaries

Night MAY: `feature reconcile`, `feature finalize`, `feature accept`, `feature prepare`,
`task unblock` for local Maestro blockers, dependency additions covered by the
accepted contract or blocker authority, `claim`, work, `complete`, `verify`,
`note`, `block`, local per-step commits on the feature branch, QA-slice, and
`feature close` for locally verified features.

Night NEVER without explicit bounded run-scoped ship authority: push, tag,
release, publish, archive, or any external ship action. Archive authority must
also be explicit auto-archive authority. Night NEVER even with ship authority:
destructive git operations, secret rotation, bypassing a platform/tool approval
failure, or hand-editing `card.yaml` or guarded sidecars. Platform/tool
approval failures are hard stops even under full local autonomy.
When auto-archive is preauthorized, the checkout whose current `.maestro` store
owns the live target card may archive after relevant worker changes are
represented in that checkout's current `HEAD`, relevant conflicts are clear, QA
evidence names the exact current `HEAD`, and the helper writes both the
`auto_archive` run event and archive-index receipt. A linked implementation
worktree may run auto-archive for its own target store when those gates pass.
A worktree whose store is missing the target card, stale, or merely copied from
another checkout stops and hands back commits, worker source, and evidence for
the checkout that owns the target store to record.

If the autonomous worker fixes an issue discovered during the loop, it must
record a durable recurrence guard before completion or ship: a regression
test, proof gate, QA checklist entry, harness friction rule, skill guidance
update, locked decision, or Memory recurrence-guard candidate. The final report
names the guard evidence.

Autonomy evidence is an audit layer only. The normal card, feature, task, QA,
proof, decision, and run stores remain authoritative. If ledger text and card
state disagree, trust the owning store and treat the mismatch as a report
defect to fix.

## Report

The session's final message is the report the human reads when they return:

- per unit: outcome plus TDD evidence (`verified, tdd: 3 cycles` or
  `verified, tdd: skipped - <reason>`) and the simplify outcome
  (`simplified` or `simplify: skipped - <non-code reason>`)
- blocked cards with reasons
- local closes with outcome, plus any close-ready-but-not-closed feature and
  the exact command to run (`maestro feature close <id> --outcome "<one line>"`)
- features prepared overnight (replenishment)
- why the loop stopped (dry, cap reached, failure budget, or hard stop)
- autonomous action table: action, target, result, redacted command, before and
  after state
- blocked/hard-stop counts, local-close count, and the run-ledger path

The report is a summary, not the record: notes, proof, card state, QA state,
and run events carry the durable evidence. `maestro query run` and
`maestro query run --json` rebuild the compact autonomy report from
`autonomy_start`, `autonomy_action`, and `auto_archive` events plus normal card
state.

## Scheduler Variant

An external scheduler (cron, launchd, a cloud schedule) can replace the
long-lived session: each firing starts one ordinary agent session, runs one
bounded loop iteration under the same prompt authority, then exits. The scheduled
session may call the choose-phase helper `maestro loop work-lease --json` to
select and claim one card, but the returned JSON is not launch authority and does
not create a worker, queue, daemon, executor, or scheduler inside Maestro. The
card store and run ledger are the only state between firings - cold-start with
`maestro resume` - and `claim` already guards overlapping firings against double
work. A firing that dies mid-card leaves its claim behind; the next firing
reclaims it once the claim crosses the existing 15-min stale TTL - the same
timeout that frees any abandoned claim, not a new mechanism. Rebuild the night's
account from durable state with `maestro query run` (its `--json` carries the
per-card trace, autonomy summary, ledger paths, and an honest interruption
verdict); never reconstruct the report from a dead firing's memory. Maestro
itself never schedules anything.

## Stop

- Do not ask the sleeping human questions; unblock or block locally according
  to the authority and hard-stop boundary, then move on.
- Do not invent caps the kickoff prompt did not state.
- Do not keep working past 3 consecutive blocks.
- Do not let the night's results live only in conversation; every outcome
  lands on a card through the verbs.

## Hand-off

On return, human: review the report and ledger, inspect local closes and any
auto-archive receipts, unblock or reassign any hard-stop cards, and decide
whether to push, tag, release, publish, or archive anything outside the
preauthorized auto-archive gate. Per-unit method -> [work.md](work.md); proof
-> [verify.md](verify.md).
