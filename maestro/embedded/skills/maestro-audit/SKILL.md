# Maestro Audit

Use this for repo-wide improvement audits. The audit is agent work; Maestro only
stores, merges, and surfaces proposals.
Architecture reviews that write an HTML report use the OS temp directory only,
not the repo.

Activate with a known session id:
`maestro hook record --event skill_activation --skill maestro-audit --session <session_id>`

Recipe checkpoint: Maestro's main workflow is the loop. Use `maestro status`
for current state and `maestro loop next` as the read-only router when the next
recipe is not obvious. Audit work uses `maestro loop show audit`. Use that
recipe as the shape for perceive -> choose -> act -> observe -> learn ->
continue: read the bounded surface, choose a falsifiable probe, run read-only
checks, observe findings, record durable proposals, then return the next audit
or hard stop. Writes still use the existing Maestro verbs named by the recipe.
Custom card/run recipes are allowed only when no shipped recipe fits, and must
use the same six phases, current Maestro verbs, hard stops, and continue output.
Rule: loop next recommends; outcome/proof/memory verbs write. Use
`maestro loop next --chain` to explain current chain position without writing,
`maestro loop outcome` to preserve structured attempt outcomes and transition
receipts after native work, `maestro loop trace <card>` to audit card-scoped
receipts, and `maestro loop improve` for read-only proposals over sourced
outcomes. Audit may file explicit harness or memory proposals. Do not use silent
recipe mutation, hidden stores, hidden schedulers, or proof/QA bypass.

## Stop

Do not implement, edit code, or change repo artifacts during this skill run.
Produce proposals only. Temp HTML architecture reports are allowed when the
architecture-review branch asks for them.
Audit findings are backlog-only during witness sign-off. File durable proposals
with `maestro harness propose`; they do not become close blockers unless they
invalidate the accepted contract, proof, QA, or risk-tier policy.

## Do

1. Read known state: `maestro status`, `maestro harness list --all`, active
   features, active tasks, decisions, and repo instructions. Pick the bounded
   audit surface before proposing findings.
2. Map the bounded audit surface from repo evidence: docs, code ownership
   boundaries, tests, scripts, and shipped embedded resources relevant to the finding.
   Native harness layer audit route: run `maestro capability` when a finding or
   review depends on optional tools, files, connectors, or host receipts; run
   `maestro maturity` when the audit needs context, acceptance, proof gaps, UX
   friction, maturity level, or next-owner evidence. Generated CLI references
   prove command shape; Harness and targeted skills teach the workflow.
   Sweep every lens so coverage is checkable, not just whatever surfaced
   first: correctness, security, performance, test coverage, tech debt,
   dependencies, developer experience, docs. The tech-debt lens includes the
   reach-ladder (HARNESS Code style): code a lower rung -- stdlib, native
   platform, an installed dependency, a one-liner -- already covers. The
   session lean mode tunes how strictly to propose these (`maestro lean`):
   `ultra` proposes replacing such code, `full`/`lite` propose the cheaper
   form, `off` skips the reach-ladder lens. `maestro lean audit` runs the
   focused, mode-adjusted reach-ladder pass; this skill still only proposes
   (no edits, no markers).
   For architecture deepening opportunities, use
   [reference/architecture-review.md](reference/architecture-review.md).
3. Vet each finding before filing: try to refute it against the live repo
   (re-read the code, re-run the command). Drop findings that do not survive.
4. Cross-check findings against Maestro state so you do not propose work already
   accepted, dismissed, measured, or covered by active tasks.
5. Re-propose every finding still seen with `maestro harness propose`
   (signatures: [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md)). Use one stable
   `--topic` per finding so the verb merges repeats, and end the `--evidence`
   text with a leverage estimate:
   `impact/effort/confidence: <H|M|L>/<H|M|L>/<H|M|L>`.

Completion criterion: every surviving finding has a `maestro harness propose`
record with stable topic, concrete evidence, and leverage estimate; every
finding that failed refutation or Maestro-state cross-check is dropped.

## Evidence

Each proposal needs concrete evidence: file paths, line numbers, command output,
or exact artifact names, plus the closing `impact/effort/confidence` estimate
(`H`, `M`, or `L` each) so the backlog ranks without re-deriving it. Do not
file style opinions without a repo-specific impact and a way to verify the
improvement.

## Hand-off

Pipeline: `[maestro-audit] -> maestro harness apply -> maestro-card`
Architecture pipeline: `[maestro-audit: architecture report] -> maestro-design
(deepening-candidate + grilling + domain-model) -> maestro-card`

Next: proposals filed -> inspect with `maestro harness list`; accepted proposals
spawn normal tasks through `maestro harness apply <id>`.
