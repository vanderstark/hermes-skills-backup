//! T6: the maestro-setup skill must instruct a bounded, per-project doc/agent-
//! spec read-in that synthesizes into the single root harness guidance and is
//! read-in only. This is a markdown skill, so its falsifier is a content guard
//! over the shipped SKILL.md (the install/sync root-only half is structurally
//! held by tests/install_mirrors.rs, which only ever plans root-relative
//! CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md writes). The resources_version_guard forces a version
//! bump + re-record on any edit; this guard asserts the read-in step is
//! actually present, not merely that the file changed.
