# Maestro Testing Guide

This guide expands the Testing Map in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Use
`ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand module ownership; use this file to choose the
smallest checks that can falsify a change.

## Default Verification

For docs-only changes:

```sh
git diff --check -- ARCHITECTURE.md TESTING.md MAINTENANCE.md
```

Also read back the changed section and check that it does not contradict
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TESTING.md`, or `MAINTENANCE.md`. If the change touches
repo-local agent instructions, include the tracked agent file path for this
checkout, such as `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.MD`.

For Rust code changes, start with the compiler:

```sh
cargo check --all-targets
```

Before handoff for a meaningful code change, run:

```sh
cargo check --all-targets
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

For a full local closeout that also proves realistic CLI workflows against the
built binary, run:

```sh
scripts/verify-all.sh
```

This runs the standard Rust gates, builds `target/debug/maestro`, then exercises
isolated greenfield and brownfield temp projects under a canonical `mktemp -d`
artifact root. It prints one `PASS <label>` line per gate and fails the final
coverage audit if any required label did not run. Use
`scripts/verify-all.sh --workflows-only` only during local script iteration, not
as the final closeout gate.

When public Rust docs, public item comments, or intra-doc links change, also
run:

```sh
cargo doc --no-deps
```

## Targeted Test Commands

Run one integration test file:

```sh
cargo test --test task_verify_integration
```

Run one integration test by name:

```sh
cargo test --test task_verify_integration task_verify_passes_with_event_proof_and_persists_verification_json
```

Run tests matching a filter:

```sh
cargo test install
```

Use targeted tests during the edit loop, then broaden when the changed contract
has callers or user data safety impact.

## Test Types

| Type | Purpose | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract tests | Prove one domain module's public behavior and invariants. | First choice for private implementation changes inside a module. |
| Adapter tests | Prove CLI, MCP, hook, shell, or TUI surfaces call domain contracts and render expected output. | Use when parsing, output, command routing, or non-CLI interface behavior changes. |
| Runtime-flow tests | Prove multiple module contracts compose in an important workflow. | Use when changing a public contract, artifact layout, or cross-module behavior. |
| Safety tests | Prove path containment, symlink rejection, rollback, backups, no partial writes, schema mismatch handling, and optimistic concurrency. | Required when user files, install state, migration, update, or managed writes are touched. |
| Read-model tests | Prove projections read source artifacts correctly without mutating them or depending on private write details. | Use when Metrics, Query, MCP, TUI, Watch, or status projections change. |

## Module Test Matrix

| Surface | Primary tests | Broaden to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation/Core | `tests/core_paths_fs.rs`, `tests/core_schema_error.rs`, `tests/core_managed_blocks.rs`, `tests/core_backup_diff_git.rs` | Any module whose safety policy uses the changed Core helper. |
| Harness | `tests/harness_templates.rs`, `tests/init_integration.rs`, `tests/harness_backlog.rs` | `tests/install_mirrors.rs`, `tests/update_integration.rs`, and Proof tests when Harness verification config changes, backlog proposal refresh changes, or explicit Harness apply behavior changes. |
| Card store and archive | `tests/card_commands_integration.rs`, `tests/card_query_e2e.rs`, `tests/doctor_query_integration.rs` | Feature, Task, Memory, Migration, archive, search/index, and schema tests when live/archived storage, DB snapshots, sidecars, or query output change. |
| Task | `tests/task_artifacts.rs`, `tests/task_commands_integration.rs`, `tests/task_verify_integration.rs` | Query, TUI, and MCP tests when task state, verification binding, or layout changes. |

| Decision | `tests/feature_decision_artifacts.rs`, `tests/feature_decision_commands_integration.rs` | Query, docs, schema-constant, and migration tests when decision layout or metadata changes. |
| Run | `tests/hook_record_integration.rs`, `tests/run_evidence_integration.rs` | `tests/task_verify_integration.rs` and `tests/harness_integration.rs` when event proof, concurrency, evidence regeneration, or harness intervention detection change. |
| Proof | `tests/task_verify_integration.rs` | Task, Query, TUI, MCP, and Run tests when verification status, freshness, report writing, unapplied reports, or binding behavior changes. Include Proof-to-Task transaction tests for stale snapshots and partial failure. |

| Install | `tests/install_mirrors.rs`, `tests/install_uninstall_integration.rs`, `tests/skills_symlink_integration.rs` | Harness, Skills, and safety tests when managed blocks, hooks, locks, symlinks, transaction state, or recovery behavior change. |
| Local release install | `tests/local_install_script.rs` | Run when the local binary install recipe, `scripts/install-local.sh`, or release-adjacent handoff instructions change. |
| Skills | `tests/global_skills_integration.rs`, `tests/skills_symlink_integration.rs`, `tests/setup_skill_context_readin.rs`, `tests/extraction_rollback.rs` | Install and Update tests when extraction rollback, recursive skill resources, executable metadata, or installed skill wiring changes. |
| Migration | Module-local tests in `src/operations/migrate.rs`, `src/operations/card_migrate.rs`, and `src/operations/container_migrate.rs` | Target domain loader or contract tests for every artifact Migration writes; direct-write exceptions need explicit fixture coverage. |
| Update | `tests/update_integration.rs`, module-local tests in `src/operations/update/mod.rs` and `src/interfaces/cli/update.rs` | Skills extraction tests, Harness non-mutation tests, and schema/migration tests when update touches bundled skills, compatibility checks, or schema drift reporting. |

`tests/support/mod.rs` is shared test support, not a standalone suite.

## Native repository-harness layer verification matrix

The native repository-harness layer is additive over existing Maestro
artifacts, so each proof category must stay mapped to a concrete test surface:

| Category | Required checks |
| --- | --- |
| parser/classifier downgrade behavior | `tests/intake_integration.rs` covers freeform downgrade, structured `card_ready`, `work_ready` downgrade, ready-owner routing, unsafe source refusal, and raw-content non-leakage. |
| capability status, permission boundary, redaction, and scoped provider lookup | `tests/capability_integration.rs` covers missing registries, present/missing/denied/unverified providers, inactive capabilities, `grants_permission: false`, receipt redaction, out-of-scope denial, and nested manifest relative paths. |
| maturity/context/friction readout stability | `tests/maturity_integration.rs` covers the `maestro.maturity.v1` JSON envelope, context rows, proof gaps, UX_GAPS friction count, maturity level, and next owner. |
| installer, sync, and shim safety | `tests/install_dry_run_integration.rs`, `tests/install_mirrors.rs`, `tests/install_uninstall_integration.rs`, and `tests/skills_symlink_integration.rs` cover dry-run, managed mirrors, backups/restore snapshots, symlink ownership, and no partial hidden writes. |
| versioned additive JSON contracts | `tests/intake_integration.rs`, `tests/capability_integration.rs`, `tests/maturity_integration.rs`, `tests/project_scope_read_surface.rs`, and schema fixture tests cover stable `{version,schema,...}` envelopes and additive fields. |
| resource guards and shipped guidance drift | `tests/resources_version_guard.rs` guards shipped Harness/skill versions and targeted guidance; `tests/cli_reference_freshness.rs` guards generated CLI reference drift. |
| edge-case guardrails | `tests/intake_integration.rs`, `tests/capability_integration.rs`, and `tests/native_layer_authority.rs` cover malformed/unsafe input, redaction, permissions, scope, stale guidance, and MIT/source-attribution non-leakage boundaries. |
| absence of forbidden lifecycle side effects | `tests/native_layer_authority.rs`, `tests/architecture_write_safety.rs`, `tests/install_dry_run_integration.rs`, and `tests/resources_version_guard.rs` cover no repository-harness docs tree, harness.db, daemon, scheduler, connector broker, hidden authority store, CAS bypass, unmanaged install write, or silent guidance drift. |

## Change Selection Rules

If changing private code inside one module, run that module's contract tests.
Then run `cargo check --all-targets`.

If reorganizing private files behind an existing module facade, run that
module's contract tests, the owning module or integration test slice, and
`cargo check --all-targets`. Use `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`
when features are relevant. Run doctests when facade docs expose import paths.
Run snapshot or golden tests when user-visible output, error text, path text, or
debug formatting can change. Broaden further when the facade exports, adapter
behavior, schema, path layout, or durable artifact behavior changed.

If adding role-grouped module roots, moving code between `interfaces/`,
`domain/`, `operations/`, or `foundation/`, or removing a legacy compatibility
path, run `cargo test --test architecture_imports`.

If adding or changing a module facade, verify that approved import paths still
work and deep implementation imports do not leak into adapters or unrelated
modules. Once a facade policy is accepted for a module, add or update a
lightweight architecture/import test for that module.
When a move splits legacy compatibility roots from target `domain::*` facades,
pin both surfaces separately: legacy roots keep old public imports, while target
facades expose only the approved contract.

If changing a module's public contract, run that module's contract tests plus
adapter and runtime-flow tests for every caller.

If changing schema versions, path layout, managed writes, backups, rollback,
or symlink policy, run the owning module tests plus the relevant safety,
migration, install, or update tests.

If changing Card live/archive storage, DB-backed snapshots, archive sweep, or
card sidecar projection, run Card store tests plus at least one runtime flow that
writes, archives, reads, and queries the affected card shape.

If changing an allowed contract edge between modules, run contract tests for
both modules and at least one runtime-flow or operation test that exercises the
edge.

If changing the Task, Proof, or Run boundary, update and run
`tests/architecture_imports.rs`. The guardrails should keep Task verification
application behind `operations/task_verify`, keep Proof on Run read-model
symbols instead of unmanaged path readers, and keep Run from importing Task
while still allowing Run event/read models to expose opaque `task_id` strings.

If changing the Install, Migration, Update, Init, Improver, or Metrics safety
boundaries, run `tests/architecture_imports.rs`. The
`operations_do_not_depend_on_interfaces`,
`domain_does_not_depend_on_interfaces_or_operations`, and
`foundation_does_not_depend_on_domain_operations_or_interfaces` guards keep the
dependency direction intact across Init, Improver, and Metrics and keep
Foundation domain-neutral; the
`install_production_sources_use_domain_facade_not_legacy_shim` guard keeps
Install as the only domain-owned orchestration exception; and the
`update_routes_schema_drift_through_migration_and_does_not_import_harness_writes`
guard keeps Update off the Harness template write surface and requires any
Migration use to go through the `operations/migrate` root facade. These are
import-boundary checks; Migration behavioral coverage lives in the
module-local migration tests named in the matrix, and Update behavioral coverage
still lives in `tests/update_integration.rs` per the rows above.

If changing current Task verification surfaces such as
`src/domain/proof/verify_task.rs`, the task verify command path,
`operations/task_verify`, Proof outcome evaluation, or Task verification
binding behavior, run `tests/task_verify_integration.rs`, Task lifecycle tests,
and focused tests for stale Task snapshots, failed Task writes leaving
verification outcome data readable through `task.yaml`, failed verification
moving a previously verified Task only through Task-owned lifecycle logic,
concurrent verifies not overwriting a fresher embedded verification binding,
Harness verify commands not replacing Task-owned `task.yaml` fields with
symlinks, legacy `verification.json` and `verification.attempts/` sidecars
being ignored as active proof state, and Proof status deriving applied/unapplied
state from the Task-owned verification binding instead of state-history text.

If changing Run append, event read models, or run evidence generation, run hook
and run evidence tests plus focused tests for concurrent same-session appends,
Stop racing with late events, idempotent evidence regeneration, partial JSONL
line tolerance, and symlinked run path handling.

If changing Install locks, managed mirrors, or uninstall ownership behavior, run
Install and Skills tests plus focused interrupted-install recovery tests: after
lock save, after partial mirror writes, reinstall recovery, and uninstall with
unverifiable ownership, persisted removing-state retry, verified JSON restore
metadata, and install-before-init Harness prerequisite behavior.

If changing Harness templates for existing repositories, run tests proving
passive update/check paths do not mutate Harness files. Run explicit Harness
apply tests that prove diff, backup, and force/apply intent before any
user-owned Harness mutation.

If changing Harness Backlog proposal refresh, run `tests/harness_backlog.rs` for
schema validation, duplicate handling, deterministic ordering,
refresh-without-apply, and read-model behavior.

If activating a reserved schema constant such as `maestro.decision.v1` or
`maestro.run.v1`, add artifact format, migration, reader, and schema tests in
the same change. If it stays reserved, tests should not require the missing
artifact.

If changing CLI output only, run `tests/cli_help.rs` when help text changes and
the command-specific integration test when command output changes.

If changing a read model, run the read-model test plus at least one flow that
produces the source artifact it reads.

If changing Memory, run `cargo test --test memory_commands_integration` for the
end-to-end CLI workflow and `cargo check --all-targets`. Broaden to
Status/Resume, Work Lease, Scorer, Proof/QA, or resource tests when the change
touches their Memory read or gate surfaces.

If changing generated or installed agent-facing files, run Install or Init tests
and read the generated artifact text in the failing or touched test fixture.

If changing editable resource content, run the owning module tests plus at least
one command integration test that writes, extracts, installs, or renders the
resource.

If changing bundled skills, run Skills tests and any Install or Update tests
that prove recursive extraction, symlink wiring, executable metadata, and
rollback behavior.

If changing bundled skill subfolders such as `references/`, `scripts/`, or
`assets/`, prove the full directory is installed under
`.maestro/skills/<skill-name>/` and that development-only `evals/` content is
not installed unless explicitly intended.

If changing Migration, run the module-local migration tests in
`src/operations/migrate.rs`, `src/operations/card_migrate.rs`, and
`src/operations/container_migrate.rs`, plus the target domain tests for
artifacts Migration creates. Migration's current direct-write exceptions are
Task artifacts, Feature registry, Decision markdown, Harness config, Run logs
under `runs/migrated/`, raw archives, backups, and rollback targets. Keep
coverage that loads or validates each target family through the owning domain
contract where practical; archive, backup, and rollback files are
Migration-owned and need explicit migration fixture assertions.

## Safety Invariants

Tests that touch user files must prove the owning module preserves these rules:

- Writes stay inside managed repo paths unless the command explicitly owns an
  external install destination.
- Symlinked managed artifacts are rejected where the owning contract requires
  path containment.
- Managed blocks and install-owned files do not delete user content.
- Failed writes roll back already-written files when the operation promises
  rollback.
- Interrupted writes have an explicit recovery or reconciliation path before
  later commands trust ownership records.
- Backups do not overwrite existing backup destinations.
- Schema mismatch errors name the expected and found schema versions.
- Optimistic concurrency failures do not silently overwrite newer task data.
- Cross-domain outcome application checks the source snapshot before mutating
  the target artifact.
- Concurrent appends to managed JSONL artifacts preserve complete lines or leave
  readers able to ignore incomplete trailing data.
- Dry-run and check modes do not write state.

## Test Style

Prefer contract tests at the owning domain module boundary. Adapter tests should
assert parsing, routing, rendering, and exit behavior without re-testing every
domain rule.

Command integration tests should run the compiled `maestro` binary through
`CARGO_BIN_EXE_maestro` and use isolated temporary repositories.

Safety tests should assert both the final artifact state and the absence of
partial or unintended files after failure.

Read-model tests should build source artifacts directly when the purpose is the
projection, and use runtime flows when the purpose is cross-module composition.

When adding a new module, command, artifact schema, or runtime flow, update:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` module ownership and Testing Map.
- This file's Module Test Matrix.
- At least one contract test for the owning module.
- Adapter or runtime-flow tests for user-facing behavior.
