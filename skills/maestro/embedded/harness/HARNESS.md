# Maestro Harness Protocol

Use local Maestro artifacts as source of truth. This is a router: status ->
route -> act -> proof -> learn.

## Start

Run `maestro status` before acting. If status or `MAESTRO_CURRENT_TASK` names a
current task, read `maestro task show <id>`. Read locked acceptance with
`maestro card show <id>` and use active task skills. Do not guess ids: use
printed ids, routine `task list` REF values, or `task list --json`. The generated
`reference/cli.md` for installed/shipped skills matching this binary is
authoritative; unlisted verbs or flags do not exist.

Native harness layer route: route imported specs, external plans, forked
repo-harness prompts, or sidechat design material through `maestro intake`
before creating work. Use `maestro capability` to read optional tools, files,
connectors, and host receipts; use `maestro maturity` to read context,
acceptance, proof gaps, UX friction, maturity level, and next owner. Use
`maestro install --dry-run` and `maestro sync --dry-run` before setup writes so
mirror and harness mutations are visible. Generated CLI references prove command
shape; Harness and targeted skills teach the workflow.
For zero-context, unfamiliar-domain, externally pasted, stakeholder-heavy, or
hosting-unclear ideas, route through `maestro-research` before `maestro-design`.
`maestro-design` may start only from fresh `research.md`, an explicit skip
receipt, or clearly settled context recorded with evidence. When available, run
`maestro research check <card-id>` first; if research is missing, stale,
risky-skipped, or hosting-incompatible, route to `maestro-research`.

## Route

Maestro's main workflow is the loop. Use `maestro status` for current state and
`maestro loop next` when routing is unclear. `loop next` is read-only: it
recommends from local artifacts and never writes cards, tasks, features,
decisions, proof, QA, git, releases, archives, or files. Read
`maestro loop show <recipe>` and write only through existing Maestro verbs.
Rule: loop next recommends; outcome/proof/memory verbs write. Use
`maestro loop next --chain` when you need the current chain position,
transition trigger, next native command, and return conditions without writing.
Use `maestro loop outcome` after action/proof/repair; transition receipts are
explicit outcome evidence, not lifecycle authority. Use `maestro loop trace
<card>` to audit card-scoped chain receipts. Use `maestro loop improve` for
read-only proposals; apply only the explicit memory, harness, proof, or QA
command it prints. No hidden stores, hidden schedulers, silent recipe mutation,
or proof/QA bypass.
Use the closest shipped lifecycle recipe: `maestro loop show design`,
`maestro loop show work`, `maestro loop show audit`, `maestro loop show ship`,
`maestro loop show unattended`, or `maestro loop show learning`.
Loop readiness is native evidence, not a claim. Use
`maestro loop validate <pattern>` and `maestro status` to read the L0 draft,
L1 report, L2 assisted, or L3 unattended level, effective operating limits,
scheduler stance, liveness, gaps, and `blocked_from_next_level`. Do not claim
L3 unattended unless those readouts say L3 and list no next-level blockers.
External schedulers stay external; Maestro remains passive/local-first and
reports readiness for external drivers instead of becoming a daemon, cron,
queue, worker launcher, or hidden executor.
When the user is unavailable but has provided a bounded design mandate, use
`maestro loop show design-relay`: the main session may make only in-mandate
design decisions, subagents/advisors provide evidence only, and the relay must
return to the parent design loop.
If no shipped recipe fits, custom card/run recipes still use perceive -> choose
-> act -> observe -> learn -> continue, current Maestro verbs, hard stops,
continue output, and no skipped proof, QA, authority, approval, or hard-stop
gates.

## Work + Proof

Work levels: High = Card, Mid = CardKind/workflow kind, Low = Task. Use
Progress through `maestro task add/start/done/list` and displayed REF values.
Before write-like work, create a visible Progress breakdown with
`maestro task setup --task ... --start`: at least two rows, or one row only with
`--atomic --reason "<why one row is enough>"`. `MAESTRO_CURRENT_TASK` does not
bypass this.
Concrete repeatable form:
`maestro task setup --task "Map current behavior" --task "Implement scoped fix" --task "Verify" --start`.
Plain `--task` rows are serial by default: row 2 waits on row 1, row 3 waits
on row 2. To author parallel Wave 1 work, use repeatable `--wave` rows and
follow-up `--then` rows, e.g.
`maestro task setup --wave "ui=Implement UI" --wave "api=Implement API" --then "verify=Verify integration" --start`.
Use `maestro task setup --after <task-alias>=<dependency-alias-or-task-id>` or
plan `after`/`blocked_by` for extra explicit dependencies; do not use inbox
messages for execution order. `maestro status` shows blocked Progress
successors under `blocked_next`; finish and verify blockers first, then use
`maestro ready` for the next executable wave.
During implementation, keep running task notes with `maestro task note <task-id> "<text>"`:
record decisions not in the handoff/spec, changes from the plan, tradeoffs,
gotchas, risks, and follow-up work. Use `maestro note <card-id>` only for card-store
notes. If a note changes scope or acceptance, amend the owning Feature/Card
contract instead of treating notes as authority.
Design-to-card gate: before executable work after design/brainstorm, ask:
- Am I coming from design or brainstorm?
- What card/feature owns this work?
- Is that card/feature handoff finalized and fresh?
If design started and ownership/fresh handoff is missing, stop before creating
Progress rows, running `feature prepare`, editing source, or running tests. Bind
standalone chat or Decision records to a Feature/card and refresh the handoff.
Do not let Progress tasks or source edits implicitly end the design phase.
Canonical work readiness is `maestro ready`: a task-wave projection from the
Task DAG. Wave 1 / `parallel_wave` rows are independent executable tasks and
may run in parallel when their files, cards, and external side effects do not
overlap. Use subagents or worktrees for that fan-out when the user allowed
delegation or the wave benefits from parallel execution; the orchestrator still
owns shared Maestro store writes. `maestro ready` also shows ready serial gates
and the bounded blocked-next frontier. `maestro loop next` uses that projection
and does not create a second scheduler; `maestro loop next --chain` explains the
derived chain overlay over the same artifacts. `maestro card ready` is the
explicit legacy card-board readiness surface.
Complete executable work with `maestro task complete` using summary, claim, and
proof. Close Progress rows with `maestro task done <ref> --proof "<evidence>"`.
Verification matches each `--claim` against recorded/inline proof; empty claims
fail. Repair proof/verification failures with the active recipe or
`maestro task proof`. Corrections: `maestro event intervention --note "<what was wrong>"`.
post-implementation close witness: after task proof, `maestro feature verify`,
and QA slice evidence are current, route through `maestro-witness` before
`maestro feature close`. The witness does not replace task proof, feature
verify, or QA; it signs off the current handoff, proof, QA, and tree refs and
requires an independent advisor receipt unless an explicit T0 user skip applies.
Routine T1 close may satisfy the advisor receipt with an auto-invoked
fresh-context subagent controlled by the main session; human review or demo is
required only when risk tier, policy, tool boundary, or explicit user direction
demands it.

## Design + Coordination

For brainstorm/unsettled behavior, use the design loop: map real code/artifacts,
ask one question at a time, lock each decision, record the note, and do not
implement until build is approved. Do not batch independent forks or edit locked
decisions.
Anti-MVP scope authority: if the user says anti-MVP, full, deep, complete,
make one forever, full framework, or rejects MVP, treat Full Durable Design as
the scope authority. Do not offer MVP, first-slice, or reduced product scope
unless the user explicitly asks for MVP. Stage the build, proof, or delivery
when needed; do not shrink the design target.
For "lock all", "all rec", or "all-recommendations", preserve each fork as a
DecisionSet child: use `maestro decision set draft` /
`maestro decision set lock`, or separate child decisions. Never compress to one
`maestro decision lock`; repair with `maestro decision audit --compressed` then
`maestro decision set repair`. Keep separate child decisions visible.
Before new/reopened ideas, search `maestro grep "<topic> corpus:memory"` and
cite the best card, decision, task, proof, or note. Use
`maestro card list --grep <topic> --archived` only for exact legacy rows or
compatibility checks.
Inbox messages are advisory. If order matters, record a Task blocker/dependency;
readiness, next, claim, and verification gates use blockers, not messages.
The card store is shared state. In fan-out, the orchestrator owns store writes;
sub-agents return data unless isolated. Use worktrees for overlapping code/store
writes. Coordinate with `maestro active`, `[overlap]`, `[CONFLICT]`, `[busy]`,
and `maestro loop show conflict-handoff`. If a multi-file store command fails,
re-run it so Maestro rereads current state and reapplies the change.

## Harness Improvement

Passive friction backlog: `maestro harness list / apply / measure`. When status,
next, or complete surfaces over-threshold friction, apply and claim it before
new work, or dismiss it with a reason when it is noise.
