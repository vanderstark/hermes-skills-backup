//! Age-based staleness signal for proposed features.
//!
//! A `proposed` feature that has not moved in [`STALE_PROPOSED_THRESHOLD_DAYS`]
//! reads as stale: it is sitting in the backlog with no build-or-retire
//! decision. The signal is deliberately age-only -- its sole inputs are the
//! feature's `updated_at` and the current time. maestro never scans git or
//! sibling cards to guess whether the work already shipped under another card;
//! the agent makes that call, prompted by the surfaced reminder.
